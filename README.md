## Notes

The followings are some challenges that I had spent a lot of time overcoming.

1. Since I used a different version of Java. When I was typing the same things as the instruction in the video, I keep getting errors.

2. Some misspellings also caused a lot of errors in my project.

3. The debugging process was annoying, and I have to be patient in order to figure out all the bugs.

However, I think the project is exciting overall. I do enjoy working on this project and trying to understand every step in the instruction video.
